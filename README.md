# 📰 Fake News Detection System

### End-to-End NLP & Machine Learning Web Application

> A production-ready Machine Learning web application that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project builds a complete machine learning pipeline to detect fake news articles. It processes raw text input, converts it into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, and predicts authenticity using a trained Logistic Regression model.

The model is integrated into a Flask web application for real-time predictions through a clean user interface.
